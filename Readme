Java program to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with dimensions M×N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. 
Assuming the colour of the piece does not matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.

Program Input:

    The dimensions of the board: M, N
    The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

As output, the program lists all the unique configurations for which all of the pieces can be placed on the board without threatening each other.

To run:
1. Import the files into an eclipse project and run ChessChallenge passing the command line arguments as follows --
	java ChessChallenge m n nking nqueen nbishop nrook nknight storeConfig
	nking, nqueen, etc. is the number of pieces of each type of piece
	storeConfig - is a boolean value to indicate if the configurations should be listed on the console
2. Run ChessChallengeTest or other test cases in the abdeali.trycatch.java.chesschallenge.test package. Make sure the JUnit test cases have their working directory set to be able to find the case data files (in the Resources folder). This is not a problem if you are running the eclipse project.


TEST CASE: total number of unique configurations for a 7×7 board with 2 Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Bishops and 1 Knight:
3063828 number of unique configurations found
Time taken: 12688ms
